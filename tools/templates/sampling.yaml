    Template sampling config.
  method: peak_median # Another option is year_round
  # Only specify when using the year_round
  year_round:
    # Time delta between timepoints.
    # Must be a divisor or 24.
    # Therefore options are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
    # Specifying 1 gives an 8760 run.
    hours_per_tp: 4
    # Hour of the first timepoint (UTC).
    # Must be less than hours_per_tp. Recommended is 0.
    first_hour: 0
    # Decide if you should skip the first day. 1 for true, 0 for false.
    # If true, it becomes a 364-day sampling.
    # This is useful since some data may be missing for day 1 due to time zone conversions.
    skip_day_one: 1
  # Only include when using the peak_median method
  peak_median:
    number_tps: 6 # Number of timepoints in a timeseries
